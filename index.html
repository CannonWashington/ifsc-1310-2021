  <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement, atleast to me, seems to focus on what the Websites being built for as opposed to the browser it will be used on. This seems like a much better approach to me, as it focuse on what the user is using the website for. It also seems much more reasonable than building for specific more advanced browsers when not everyone uses the same browsers.</p>

  <h2>Website Revision</h2>
  <p>I enjoyed the semester. I learned a lot about Web Design that I needed, and unlike the last time I took a Web Design class I actually enjoyed it much more this time. Previously I didn't really care about Web Design because I knew I likely wouldn't do it, and I still might not, but I moved past not caring about another Programming language because I won't use it.</p>
  <p>This Project helped me learn more things about design, which is still something I struggle with, and will continue to struggle with. However, this project, and your class, has helped me in regards to that. </p>
  <p>I had a family member review it, and they pointed a few things out, such as having more "Posted by Cannon Washington" footers than needed, and them being in awkward places, as well as the paragraphs covering the entire page. They said my colors were nice, though they could be better, though I've never had an eye for design, and couldn't really find anything better myself. If I had to start over I would focus more on the color scheme. I also realised that I had an image that wasn't properly coded in, so I fixed that. </p>
